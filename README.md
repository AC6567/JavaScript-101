# JavaScript 101
Welcome to my JavaScript 101 test platform. This tutorial is designed to quiz you on the basics of JavaScript while familiarizing yourself with using the command line for coding. To begin, the first 10 problems can be answered in format for declaring a variable. In other words, if the question is - what color is the sky, your answer would be var blue;. Make sure that you use correct syntax (camelCase, ; use etc.) or the solution will not pass. In future lessons, the answers will increase in difficulty.

This workshop was built using Node.js using the [NodeSchool](nodeschool.io) workshopper platform.

So let's get you set up to run this tool.

## Install Node.js

Make sure Node.js is installed on your computer.

Install it from [nodejs.org/download](http://nodejs.org/download)

On Windows and using v4 or v5 of Node.js? Make sure you are using at least 5.1.0, which provides a fix for a bug on Windows where you can't choose items in the menu.

### Install `JavaScript-101` with `npm`

Open your terminal and run this command:

```
npm install --global javascripting
```

The `--global` option installs this module globally so that you can run it as a command in your terminal.

#### Having issues with installation?

If you get an `EACCESS` error, the simplest way to fix this is to rerun the command, prefixed with sudo:

```
sudo npm install --global JavaScript-101
```

You can also fix the permissions so that you don't have to use `sudo`. Take a look at this npm documentation:
https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions

## Run the workshop

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```
JavaScript-101
```

You'll see the welcome menu:


Navigate the menu with the up & down arrow keys.

Choose a challenge by hitting enter.

<!-- ### Take a look at this gif that shows the first challenge: -->

In the gif I'm using the command line editor `nano` ([here are some basic usage tips for nano](https://github.com/sethvincent/dev-envs-book/blob/master/chapters/05-editors.md#nano)).   -->

You can use any editor you like.

[atom](http://atom.io) or [brackets](http://brackets.io/) are both good options.

## Need help with an exercise?

Open an issue in the nodeschool/discussions repo: https://github.com/nodeschool/discussions

Include the name `JavaScript-101` and the name of the challenge you're working on in the title of the issue.

## TODOS:
- Add more test questions
- Add menu screenshots
